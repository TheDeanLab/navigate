**navigate** is an open-source Python software for general microcsope control. It focuses
on smart microscopy applications by providing reusable acquisition and analysis routines,
termed :ref:`features <features>`, that can be chained
in arbitrary orders to create custom acquistion protocols.

   This project is under active development. See our `GitHub repository for updates
   <https://github.com/TheDeanLab/navigate>`_.
