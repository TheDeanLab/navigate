We currently support laser control via voltage signals. In the near-future, we will consider implementing
laser control via serial communication for power control, but digital modulation will still be controlled via
voltage signals.

Analog/Digital-Controlled Lasers
--------------------------------

Most lasers are controlled externally via mixed analog and digital modulation.
The ``onoff`` entry is for digital modulation. The ``power`` entry is for analog
modulation.

.. note::
    Omicron LightHUB Ultra laser launches include both Coherent- and LuxX lasers,
    which vary according to wavelength. LuxX lasers should be operated in an ACC
    operating mode with the analog modulation option enabled. The Coherent Obis lasers
    should be set in the mixed modulation mode.

.. note::
    Coherent Obis lasers should be set in the mixed modulation mode. It is not uncommon
    for the slew rate from the data acquisition card to be insufficient to drive the modulation
    of the laser if the laser is set to an analog modulation mode.
