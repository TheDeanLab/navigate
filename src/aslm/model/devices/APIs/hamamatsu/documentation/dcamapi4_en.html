					DCAM-API is an application software program interface to control digital cameras and detecting systems manufactured by HAMAMATSU (hereafter referred to simply as "devices"). 					The DCAM-API installer is downloadable from our website, http://www.dcamapi.com, and it consists of the kernel drivers and DCAM modules which are the core part of DCAM-API itself. They are prepared for each digital I/F, e.g. IEEE 1394, USB, various frame grabber, etc. The DCAM-API installer also installs a manager for all modules to give a transparent control for different device models from the host software.

				</div>
				<div>
					The SDK consists of header files, library files, reference files of DCAM-API functions, and source code of sample host software to provide knowledge on how to access DCAM-API. The SDK user is free to use this software in any way they like, such as partially modifying source code and creating completely separate program, and/or giving the host software or plugin module to everyone. But the following is not allowed; opening the resources that get from HAMAMATSU as SDK; making a wrapper module that is almost the same as DCAM-API itself.

					Concept of DCAM-API is to provide easy development. Under this concept, DCAM-API provides common method to control the same functions in different devices and almost all of functionality are for capturing image and controlling the device. There are no functions for displaying or GUI control. Therefore, the number of functions has been limited to the minimum. For common use, format of calling function are defined in the C programming language.

Those values mean the result of processing, so the values are unstable and not defined by DCAMERR.					You can use failed() function to check whether the function is success or not.					This function returns TRUE when the argument value means the error.

Every property value is handled as double floating value even if it is an integer on the device. 					Each property has its own, name, attributes, minimum, maximum, stepping, and/or default values.  Some properties are enumerative types and their values also have associated text. We call such text as value text.

					There are three property value types: MODE, LONG, and REAL.  These values are operated with 64bit double float variables.  However, LONG and MODE are regarded as 32bit signed integer internally where as REAL is regarded as a 64bit float decimal.  The LONG and REAL types are numerical values.  The MODE type is not a numerical value but DCAM-API regards it as integer with unique IDs.  Every MODE has text for each assigned value. Some LONG and REAL properties also have text.

					The host software can distinguish each value type with DCAMPROP_TYPE_MASK from the attribute member of the DCAMPROP_ATTR structure.  Every property value on the device is associated with one of these three types.  However the property value type may be changed in a future version of DCAM-API.  It is recommended that the host software checks the attribute member of DCAMPROP_ATTR structure for the value type to ensure compatibility, instead of assuming the property value type is fixed. 					The host software can check the default value and range of each property which is also available through the DCAMPROP_ATTR structure.

For example, DCAM_IDPROP_SENSORTEMPERATURETARGET is readable and writable in some devices, but it is read-only in other devices.

					DCAM properties are parameters for the device and related hardware. The host software can get and set the property values that are specified by property IDs.  There are two method to get the property IDs. You can use predefined property IDs in dcamprop.h directly.  This header defines many DCAM property IDs. Be aware that not all properties are supported by some devices.  Always check if the device supports the property before using it directly.  Another method to get the property IDs is by enumeration.  DCAM-API supports property ID enumeration to provide the host software a listing of all supported properties of the current device.  DCAM-API also provides information of a property with the dcamprop_getattr() function. This function requires the DCAMPROP_ATTR structure as an input.  This can tell the kind of value, the range of values, various attributes, etc.

					The dcamprop_getnextid() function provides the next property ID supported by the device. This function provides the ability to retrieve all property IDs that the device supports. This can also enumerate a listing of properties that have been updated when a property is changed. But the elements of array property cannot be enumerated. It is necessary for them to enumerate with the attribute that the base of array property has. The base of array property is enumerated by dcamprop_getnextid(). The dcamprop_getname() function provides the name text of a property.  The dcamprop_getvaluetext() function with the DCAMPROP_VALUETEXT structure provides the value text of a specified value of a property.

				<div>
					To capture images, the host software needs to prepare a receiving buffer. There are two method to perform this. 					The first method is to use the dcambuf_alloc() function to allocate the frame buffer in the DCAM module. This is the most efficient way to receive images from the device. However, by using this method the host software needs to call the dcambuf_lockframe() function to access this data or the dcambuf_copyframe() function to copy it. 					The second method is to use the dcambuf_attach() function to attached a memory buffer created by the host software. By using this method, the image will be written directly to the user buffer.  Therefore the host software will be capable of accessing the data without calling dcambuf_lockframe() or dcambuf_copyframe().  Be aware that some devices and/or interfaces may not support the standard data type. In this case, the DCAM module transforms the data type so the performance may be worse than the first method of using the dcambuf_alloc() function. 					Before starting a capture, the host software must call either dcambuf_alloc() or dcambuf_attach().  When the capture is completed and the host software no longer needs the data, the host software can call the dcambuf_release() function to release the internal receiving buffer in the DCAM module allocated by dcambuf_alloc(), or to detach the memory that was attached by dcambuf_attach().

					If the host software uses the dcambuf_alloc() function to create the image buffer, it will need to use the dcambuf_lockframe() or dcambuf_copyframe() function to access captured image data.					The dcambuf_lockframe() function returns a pointer to the data which the host software can use to access the image. In this function, DCAM modules copy image data from primary buffer to reserved memory with necessary conversion. Primary buffer is receiving buffer which hardware and/or lower driver directly copies to. 					The dcambuf_copyframe() function copies data from DCAM primary buffer to buffer which is specified by DCAMBUF_FRAME structure and managed by host software.

				<div class="title">meta data</div>
				<div>
					DCAM-API supports three kinds of system defined meta data, TIMESTAMP, FRAMESTAMP and CAMERASTAMP. TIMESTAMP is the timing on received the image. The timing itself can be varied. For example, one is that the camera measure and output the start timing of readout, other is that DCAM module measure the timing of data stream from the interface. To know the detail of this timing, the host software should check the value of DCAM_IDPROP_TIMING_TIMESTAMP and DCAM_IDPROP_TIMESTAMP_PRODUCER. TIMESTAMP_PRODUCER is what records the timing. TIMING_TIMESTAMP is what timing is in data stream. FRAMESTAMP is the number of image. This value is increased by the camera or DCAM on readout. CAMERASTAMP is the value that the host software set to the camera. To get this meta data, the host software can use the dcambuf_lockframe() or dcambuf_copyframe() function. This meta data is included in DCAMBUF_FRAME structure is argument of the function. For TIMESTAMP, the host software can use the dcambuf_attach() function with DCAMBUF_ATTACHKIND_TIMESTAMP. This allows the DCAM module to fill the TIMESTAMP information into the user allocated memory directly.  The dcambuf_copymetadata() function is also available to get multiple TIMESTAMPs at once with the DCAM_TIMESTAMPBLOCK structure.

					When DCAM_IDPROP_FRAMEBUNDLE_MODE is enabled, the method of accessing the information in DCAMBUF_ATTACH::buffer may differ depending on the value of dcambuf_attach::iKind.					If dcambuf_attach::iKind = DCAMBUF_ATTACHKIND_FRAME, then the number of images (bundled images) specified by DCAM_IDPROP_FRAMEBUNDLE_NUMBER will be stored as shown in the above figure.					On the other hand, if dcambuf_attach::iKind = DCAMBUF_ATTACHKIND_PRIMARY_TIMESTAMP/FRAMESTAMP is specified, the metadata will be stored as shown below.					In this case, to access the first address of the bufferIndex of each frame with nNewestFrameIndex, use the surplus of nNewestFrameIndex*FRAMEBUNDLE_NUMBER divided by DCAMBUF_ATTACH::buffercount.

					To begin capturing images, the host software should call the dcamcap_start() function. If the driver is not ready to begin capturing, e.g. dcambuf_alloc() has not been called yet, the dcamcap_start() function will return a DCAMERR. The dcamcap_start() function also has a  DCAMCAP_START input that controls the capturing method. 					DCAMCAP_START_SEQUENCE sets continuous capturing.  When the capturing reaches the final allocated frame, it will continue to capture more data going back to the first frame and overwritten the existing data. 					DCAMCAP_START_SNAP sets a single cycle capturing.  When the capturing reaches the final allocated frame in this mode, the capturing stops. 					When the host software calls the dcamcap_stop() function, capturing is stopped.

					The host software can check the capturing status with the dcamcap_status() function. It will return a DCAMCAP_STATUS.  The dcamcap_transferinfo() function returns the total number of images captured and the frame index of the last captured image.  These functions do not wait for any events and will return with their values immediately.  These functions are useful for polling however this is stressful to the CPU.  We recommend using dcamwait functions to wait for events such as the arrival of new frames, then calling these functions to check status and/or transferred information.

				<div class="title">Software trigger</div>
				<div>
					The DCAM module supports software trigger if it is supported in the device.  In some cases if the device does not support it, the DCAM module may emulate software triggering. Therefore, in almost all cases the host software can use software trigger.  To use software trigger, the host software needs to set DCAMPROP_TRIGGERSOURCE__SOFTWARE to the DCAM_IDPROP_TRIGGERSOURCE property and start capturing.  When the host software calls the dcamcap_firetrigger() function, the DCAM Module fires a trigger to device.  If dcamcap_firetrigger() is called before the camera is ready to receive the trigger signal, the DCAM module will wait until the device can recognize the trigger, then it will fire. If the host software needs to synchronize with other devices, it can call the dcamcap_firetrigger() function when these other devices are ready.

					DCAM-API can record images to disk simultaneously while capturing. To do this, after preparing HDCAMREC handle, host software needs to call dcamcap_record() function before calling dcamcap_start() function. 					This is a one time function so if host software wants to record again at next capturing, it has to call dcamcap_record() function again.

The capturing events are named with the DCAMWAIT_CAPEVENT_ prefix and recording events are named with the DCAMWAIT_RECEVENT_ prefix.  Timeout is specified by the DCAMWAIT_START::timeout member.  The timeout is defined in milliseconds. To wait indefinitely until the event comes, the timeout value should be set to DCAMWAIT_TIMEOUT_INFINITE.  To cancel the waiting, call the dcamwait_abort() function to terminate the waiting specified by the HDCAMWAIT handle.

To start recording, the dcamcap_record() function should be called during READY state.  Finally, calling the dcamcap_start() function after dcamcap_record() starts the recording.  When the host software calls the dcamrec_close() function, all of the file information is stored. Be aware that if the host software terminates without calling the dcamrec_close() function, some data may be lost.

If the host software wants to resume the recorder during capturing, the dcamrec_resume() function should be called, however this will need additional time to prepare the file. When the capturing has ended or the recorder has reached the specified recording frame number, the recorder will automatically stop. To get the current recording status, use the dcamrec_status() function. If DCAMREC_STATUS::flags has DCAMREC_STATUSFLAG_RECORDING flag, recording is in process.

DCAM_IDPROP_RECORDFIXEDBYTES_PERFRAME is per frame, DCAM_IDPROP_RECORDFIXEDBYTES_PERFILE and DCAM_IDPROP_RECORDFIXEDBYTES_PERSESSION are per file and session.					Following equation returns recording data size: (RECORDFIXEDBYTES_PERFILE + File meta data size) + (RECORDFIXEDBYTES_PERSESSION + Session meta data size) + ((RECORDFIXEDBYTES_PERFRAME + Frame meta data size) * Number of Frames).

If the option argument is set to DCAMPROP_OPTION_PRIOR or DCAMPROP_OPTION_NEXT, this function will return the prior or next value. If the device does not support the property, this function will fail with the error code DCAMERR_NOTSUPPORT. If the device supports the property but the prior or next values are out of range, this function will fail with the error code DCAMERR_OUTOFVALUE.

						The dcamprop_getnextid() function provides a way to query all supported property IDs of a device. 						If the host software calls this function with the iProp value set to 0, the function will return the next property ID in the iProp value.  If the host software calls the dcamprop_getnextid() function in a loop where you set iProp with the value of the previous property ID, you will be able to retrieve all the property IDs that the device supports.  The end of the list is determined when iProp returns 0.  If the device does not support the input property ID, the property ID will be the next value which it supports.  Please see Sample - Enumerate supported properties. 						If the host software sets the option DCAMPROP_OPTION_UPDATED, this function enumerates only the properties that the value have changed.  If the host software sets the option DCAMPROP_OPTION_VOLATILE, this function enumerates all of the VOLATILE properties.

						The dcambuf_attach() function assigns allocated memory as the capturing buffer for the host software. DCAM will transfer the image data directly from the device to these buffers. 						The dcambuf_attach() function should be called after setting necessary properties and before calling dcamcap_start() function. The dcambuf_alloc() function is exclusive. 						The host software can get the required buffer size by getting the property value of DCAM_IDPROP_BUFFER_FRAMEBYTES. DCAM does not verify if the frame buffer pointers are valid.  The system may hang up if the frame buffer pointers contain an invalid address. 						If the host software no longer requires the attached buffer, the dcambuf_release() function should be called to release the buffer from DCAM.

Before calling this function, the DCAMWAIT_START structure should be initialize size member, eventmask member and timeout member. eventmask member should be filled with DCAM events which host software wants to wait. The DCAM events are assigned to individual bits so eventmask member can have several events. 						timeout member specifies how long this function will wait as maximum by mili-seconds. If host software wants to wait until event happens, please set DCAMWAIT_TIMEOUT_INFINITE value. 						When the function succeeded, eventhappened member is set with one of DCAMWAIT_EVENT values which were set in eventmask member. If any DCAM events did not happen, function returns DCAMERR_TIMEOUT error. And if host software calls aborting function, e.g. dcamwait_abort(), function returns DCAMERR_ABORT error.

						The dcamrec_lockframe() function returns a pointer that the host software can use to access the recorded image data. Next calling this function will prepare new data, so parameter which was filled by last call is no more available. 						To avoid this situation, it is better host software calls dcamrec_lockframe() function from A thread. 						If host software needs to copy image data into its own memory, dcamrec_copyframe() function is suitable. 						If the image frame which is specified by DCAMREC_FRAME::iFrame is not filled yet, dcamrec_lockframe() function will return DCAMERR_BUSY.
